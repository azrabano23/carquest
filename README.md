# Project Overview:
# 🚗 CarQuest – Personalized Car Recommendation Engine

**CarQuest** is an intelligent car recommender system that helps users find vehicles tailored to their budget, preferences, and location. Built using machine learning and database technology, it enables consumers to explore fuel-efficient and cost-effective cars, predict pricing trends, and interact with a dynamic recommendation engine.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The average car buyer spends **over 15 hours researching vehicles online**, often overwhelmed by too many listings and unclear comparisons.  
> *(Source: Cox Automotive Car Buyer Journey Study, 2023)*

Despite access to large volumes of data, users often struggle to identify cars that actually meet their needs — especially when juggling factors like **brand, price, fuel efficiency, and city-specific availability**.

**CarQuest** addresses this by combining predictive analytics and dynamic querying to serve personalized car recommendations — saving time, improving decisions, and increasing buyer confidence.

## 🧠 Why This Program Matters

- ✅ **Over 70% of millennials and Gen Z** say fuel efficiency and price are the top two factors in car-buying decisions.
- ✅ **Used car prices rose 26%+ in recent years**, making price prediction more important than ever.
- ✅ Users demand **customized search experiences**, not generic listings.

CarQuest transforms raw car data into tailored insights, helping users:
- Discover the **most fuel-efficient options**
- Predict a car's **market value**
- Find **city-specific deals**
- Make **informed, data-backed decisions**

## 🚀 What the Program Does

### 🔍 Dynamic Car Recommendations
- Search cars by **brand**, **price range**, and **city**.
- Filter results using SQL queries from a built-in **SQLite database**.
- Displays relevant matches in a clean, structured output.

### 📈 Machine Learning Insights
- Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict car prices using features like brand, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.
- Evaluates model performance using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared (R²) score**

### ♻️ Fuel Efficiency Insights
- Automatically identifies and highlights the **most fuel-efficient car** in the dataset.

### 🧠 Interactive User Experience
- Dynamically collects user input for search filters.
- Provides **real-time feedback** and **error handling** for invalid inputs.
- Continuously adapts based on user choices.
